# How do I install a userscript?

A userscript is a program that modifies webpages by executing JavaScript on particular pages on load.

To achieve this, a **userscript manager** is required. This is usually a browser extension.

## Installing a userscript manager

All userscripts in this repository require a userscript manager. You can install the appropriate one for your browser here:

| Browser  | Installation Link |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Chrome  | [Tampermonkey (Chrome Web Store)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) |
| Chrome  | [Tampermonkey (Mac App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1482490089) |
| Microsoft Edge | [Tampermonkey (Edge Add-ons)](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd) |
| Firefox  | [Greasemonkey (Firefox ADD-ONS)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) |

## Installing a userscript

There are two ways to install a userscript. You can do it by clicking an installation link, or by creating a script manually and pasting the code into it.

### Installation Link

Sometimes the userscript will have an installation link. When you click it, it will open a new window prompting you to install the script:

Simply click the 'Install' button to install the userscript.

### Manually creating the script

If the userscript has no installation link, you'll have to install the script manually.

For **Tampermonkey**, open the extension, click 'Create a new script...', paste the code into the text area, and save the file (with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>).

For **Greasemonkey**, open the extension, click 'New user script...', paste the code into the textarea, and save the file (with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>).
